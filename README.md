## Overview
This my second challenge from frontendmentor.io. Basically the difficulty for the challenge is still for the newbie and only need basic HTML and CSS language to design this project. Since I  am a beginner, so this project is important to me in order to help me to train my skill on designing the website.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
